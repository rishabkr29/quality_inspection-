# quality_inspection
Automated Quality Inspection System for Manufacturing: A manufacturing
facility produces some components and needs automated visual inspection to detect defects
before packaging. Task: Develop a computer vision solution to identify and classify defects on
items of your choice. Requirements:
1. Choose any manufactured item with visible features (PCBs, fabric, printed materials,
etc.) for your prototype.
2. Capture or source actual images containing at least 3 types of defects (scratches,
misalignment, missing components, discoloration, etc.) along with defect-free samples.
3. Write a script that:
1. Analyzes an input image of the product
2. Detects and localizes defect regions (bounding boxes or segmentation masks)
3. Classifies each defect type with confidence scores
4. Outputs the (x, y) pixel coordinates of defect centers and severity assessment
4. Submit sample images (defective and non-defective) with annotations in the github
repository
